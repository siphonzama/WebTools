# WebTools
I am excited to be developing a web tool that will help people discover both free and subscription-based resources for their work and hobbies. This personal project is an excellent opportunity for me to learn how to build and design websites effectively. The goal is to make it easier for users to find the web tools and resources they need.

I will be updating this readme daily as I progress in building the site, documenting all the lessons and insights I gain throughout this journey.

I've spent the past few days diving into HTML and CSS, and it's been fantastic to see the webpage come together. I’m gaining a solid understanding of HTML tags and their functions, and I'm learning how CSS enhances the aesthetic of basic webpages.

Today, I found out that I need to host the images I plan to use on a server. This ensures that visitors can access the images without relying on my personal computer. While I feel a bit frustrated about not realizing this sooner, I am fully committed to refining this website and mastering the tools necessary to make it work flawlessly.

I have also learned how to use CSS to customize the page with styling and classes, giving it more personality. Additionally, I started using comments to clarify different sections of my code. I will focus on how I want the webpage to look so I can apply the CSS techniques I learn.

Today, I focused on enhancing my understanding of CSS styles for the project. I learned that it's beneficial to keep style elements in their own separate file. Therefore, I created a file called `style.css`. This approach will make it easier to manage both HTML and CSS since they will be organized in distinct files, simplifying future updates.

Additionally, I realized that I should explore different ways to display lists of other tools. Instead of using ordered lists, I’m considering alternative formats. My goal is to create a system where, when a user selects a tool, it directs them to a separate page that provides a description of the tool, how it’s used, and its benefits. I also want to include a link to the tool on that secondary page. I need to work on figuring out how to implement this in the next few days.

Furthermore, I reached out to several HTML, CSS, and JavaScript programmers for assistance. I hope they can help me better sort my code and guide me to keep it simple and manageable, making future updates to the website easier.

I have been focusing on improving my understanding of classes, styles, and selectors in coding. I realized that the initial approach I took for my code was too minimal and lacked customizability. This made it challenging to update and maintain the webpage in the future. I see now that my planning was inadequate, and I didn’t consider several key factors before creating the page.

Going forward, I plan to rework my approach and adjust the code to make it easier to manage and update. This will also give me the opportunity to connect with more people and gather additional resources that will enhance my understanding of writing code in a way that is easy to read, comprehend, and update. In this process, I believe it is essential to invest my time and energy into engaging with others and improving my problem-solving approach. I tend to rush into solutions, but I need to take more time to evaluate the effectiveness of my solutions and whether they truly address the problem at hand.
