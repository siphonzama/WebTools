# WebTools
I am excited to be developing a web tool that will help people discover both free and subscription-based resources for their work and hobbies. This personal project is an excellent opportunity for me to learn how to build and design websites effectively. The goal is to make it easier for users to find the web tools and resources they need.

I will be updating this readme daily as I progress in building the site, documenting all the lessons and insights I gain throughout this journey.

I've spent the past few days diving into HTML and CSS, and it's been fantastic to see the webpage come together. Iâ€™m gaining a solid understanding of HTML tags and their functions, and I'm learning how CSS enhances the aesthetic of basic webpages.

Today, I found out that I need to host the images I plan to use on a server. This ensures that visitors can access the images without relying on my personal computer. While I feel a bit frustrated about not realizing this sooner, I am fully committed to refining this website and mastering the tools necessary to make it work flawlessly.
